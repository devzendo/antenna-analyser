antenna-analyser
================

Code, documents and details of one way to construct Beric Dunn K6BEZ' inexpensive antenna analyser.

Details of Beric's project's several variations, and schematics can be found at http://www.hamstack.com/project_antenna_analyzer.html

This repository, and the blog posts at http://mattgumbley.wordpress.com/category/amateur-radio/antenna-analyser/ hold
details of my construction attempts, board layouts, component costs, software, tests, and articles on VSWR (my
attempts to learn more about it by writing about it) and RF circuit design.
